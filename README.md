Welcome everyone on this "Python Programming Tutorial"
I am Jeevan Arande and I have more than two years of programming experience.I feel programming is a lot of fun, and besides, it also gets their work done.Python is an easy to learn language as many beginners choose their first programming language as Python and it is not limited to web development,build games and applications but also Statistical analysis,Machine Learning,Deep Learning can also be done successfully. If you are new to programming or simply interested in learning Python, here are some resources you can use.
   Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
